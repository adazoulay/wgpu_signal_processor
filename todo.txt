Note: For EQ curve drawing, look at interpolation 


Incorporating AudioGraph:
Your AudioGraph would be a network of interconnected AudioNodes. Each AudioNode might represent an audio source, a series of effects, and an output. The AudioGraph would be responsible for managing the connections and the flow of audio data through these nodes.

rust
Copy code
struct AudioGraph {
    nodes: Vec<AudioNode>,
    edges: Vec<(usize, usize)>, // Connects node indices, implying data flow direction
    // ... other methods to add nodes, connect nodes, process, etc.
}
Your AudioProcessor can then utilize this AudioGraph to determine how audio data should flow and be processed.

UML Diagram:
Below is a textual representation of a UML class diagram for your system. Note that this is not actual UML syntax but rather a description of the relationships:

Copy code
AudioGraph:
    - nodes: AudioNode[]
    - edges: tuple[]
    + add_node(node: AudioNode): void
    + connect_nodes(node1: AudioNode, node2: AudioNode): void
    + process(clip: AudioClip): void

AudioNode:
    - source: AudioSource (can be InputSource, FileSource, etc.)
    - effect_chain: AudioEffectChain
    - output: OutputSource

AudioSource (interface):
    + get_audio(): AudioClip

InputSource (implements AudioSource):
    - device: Device
    - supported_config: SupportedStreamConfig
    + record(): AudioClip

OutputSource:
    - device: Device
    - supported_config: SupportedStreamConfig
    + play(clip: AudioClip): void

AudioEffectChain:
    - effects: AudioEffect[]
    + add_effect(effect: AudioEffect): void
    + process(clip: AudioClip): void

AudioEffect (interface):
    + apply(clip: AudioClip): void

VariousEffects (e.g., EQ, Shift, etc., implements AudioEffect):
    // Specific fields and methods for each effect

AudioClip:
    - samples: float[]
    - sample_rate: int
    + get_sample(): float
    + add_clip(clip: AudioClip): void
    // ... other methods

AudioProcessor:
