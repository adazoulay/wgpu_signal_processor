Incorporating AudioGraph:
Your AudioGraph would be a network of interconnected AudioNodes. Each AudioNode might represent an audio source, a series of effects, and an output. The AudioGraph would be responsible for managing the connections and the flow of audio data through these nodes.

rust
Copy code
struct AudioGraph {
    nodes: Vec<AudioNode>,
    edges: Vec<(usize, usize)>, // Connects node indices, implying data flow direction
    // ... other methods to add nodes, connect nodes, process, etc.
}
Your AudioProcessor can then utilize this AudioGraph to determine how audio data should flow and be processed.

Below is a textual representation of a UML class diagram for your system. Note that this is not actual UML syntax but rather a description of the relationships:

!!! FIX BOUNDS METHOD

You've correctly identified the issue. The resize_clips method tries to lock the clip again, which is already locked in the prepare_child_for_operation method via the child_clip: MutexGuard<'_, AudioClip<F>> = child_node.get_delta_clip(); line. This causes a deadlock as the Mutex is non-reentrant, meaning once locked, even the same thread cannot lock it again until it's unlocked.

To fix this, you'll need to refactor the code to ensure that you aren't trying to lock the Mutex while it's already locked.

Here's one approach:

Separate locking from action: Refactor get_clip, get_delta_clip, etc., to just return the mutex and let the caller handle the locking.
rust
Copy code
pub fn clip_mutex(&self) -> &Mutex<AudioClip<F>> {
    &self.clip
}
Similarly, for get_delta_clip and get_prev_clip.

Refactor resize_clips: Now, resize_clips should accept the locked MutexGuards instead of trying to lock them itself:
rust
Copy code
pub fn resize_clips(&self, clip: &mut AudioClip<F>, delta_clip: &mut AudioClip<F>, prev_clip: &mut AudioClip<F>, new_size: usize, value: F) {
    clip.resize_frames(new_size, value);
    delta_clip.resize_frames(new_size, value);
    prev_clip.resize_frames(new_size, value);
}
Use the refactored methods in prepare_child_for_operation:
rust
Copy code
pub fn prepare_child_for_operation(
    parent_node: &AudioNode<F>,
    child_node: &AudioNode<F>,
) -> (usize, usize) {
    let mut parent_clip = parent_node.clip_mutex().lock().unwrap();
    let mut child_clip = child_node.clip_mutex().lock().unwrap();
    let mut child_delta_clip = child_node.delta_clip_mutex().lock().unwrap();
    let mut child_prev_clip = child_node.prev_clip_mutex().lock().unwrap();

    // ... rest of your code ...

    if new_child_end > child_clip.get_length() {
        child_node.resize_clips(&mut *child_clip, &mut *child_delta_clip, &mut *child_prev_clip, new_child_end, F::EQUILIBRIUM);
        // Note: We use &mut * to dereference the MutexGuard and then get a mutable reference
    }

    // ... rest of your code ...
}
This approach separates the locking concern from the action, giving the caller full control over the locking mechanism and avoiding nested locks.
